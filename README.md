Formilk is a system of configurable webcomponents designed by [UpperCod](https://twitter.com/uppercod) and created with [Atomico](http://github.com/atomicojs/atomico), Formilk is created to:

1. offer a series of useful webcomponents when creating design systems.
2. Configurable through a token system represented by custom properties.
3. Be agnostically friendly with third party libraries, eg Html, React, Preact and others.
4. Communicate states to forms, Whether formilk webcomponents can be used inside a `<form>` tag.
